This repository contains some of the common Machine Learning models which I will apply on different datasets. 
It will start with Linear Regression and then I will cover Logistic Regression, Ploynomial Regression, Principle component analysis, Decision Tree,
Random Forest, Boosted Tree and Neural Networks at the end.
